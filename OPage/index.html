        <p>The Sun is an almost endless source of clean energy that radiates over the Earth every day. Each second, the sun emits enough power onto earth that can satisfy the entire human energy demand for over two hours.</p>

      <p> Given that it is readily available and renewable, solar power is an attractive source of energy. However, as of 2018, less than two percent of the world`s energy came from solar. Historically, solar energy harvesting has</p>
      
      
       <p>been expensive and relatively inefficient. Even this meager solar usage, though, is an improvement over the previous two decades, as the amount of power collected from solar energy worldwide increased over 300-fold</p>
       
       <p> from 2000 to 2019. New technological advances over the last twenty years have driven this increased reliance on solar by decreasing costs, and new technological developments promise to augment this solar usage by</p>
       
       <p> further decreasing costs and increasing solar panel efficiency.</p>
       
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p2> The increase in the popularity of solar power energy is a result of the expansion of the technologies associated with it. Nowadays, there are two types of technologies that are used to generate solar energy.</p2>
